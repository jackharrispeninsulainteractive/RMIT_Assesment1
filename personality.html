                <div class="row">

                        <h5 style="text-align: center"><strong><u>My Results</u></strong></h5>
                       <p style="text-align: center">For the Myers Briggs test by 16 personalities, I received the result of INTJ-A, from examining the online information I can determine that this means I have an unbelievable keen an inquisitive mind, I have a strong focused on independence and self-reliance, I am determined and versatile in my abilities and strengths and can overcome most tasks that life can throw my way.
                           <br><br>
                           However, this is reflected in a potential for arrogance, a combative nature, and a overly critical mind that tends to judge and write off people with out giving them a second change. As an architect I am a fantastic problem solver for complex tasks but lack key skills and understanding around human emotion and interactions.
                           <br><br>
                           Since performing this test It has open my eyes and gives me the impression I’m reading my own book or looking into a mirror, with a vast and large portion of my mind and history aligning with the strength and weakness associated with this personality type.

                    <div class="col-sm">
                        <h5><strong><u>Weakness</u></strong></h5>
                        <p>The fantastic strengths that architects possess come with some significant trade-offs, most with the most notable being, Arrogance, Dismissive, Combative and Overly Critical.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <ol style="list-style: none">
                            <li>
                                <h6><strong> <i class="fas fa-times" style="color:red"></i> Arrogant</strong></h6>
                                <p>Due to architects’ lust for knowledge and their informed and independent nature they have a tendency to become arrogant and overconfident in their ideas and beliefs.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6><strong> <i class="fas fa-times" style="color:red"></i> Dismissive of Emotions</strong></h6>
                                <p>As we learned in the strength’s rationality is valued above all else this has led to architects dismissing and disregarding emotions. This can manifest in architects appearing ignorant and impatient with anyone who has value and respect for feels and emotions.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6><strong> <i class="fas fa-times" style="color:red"></i> Overly Critical</strong></h6>
                                <p>An architect will have a great deal of self-control specifically aimed at their internal politics, feelings, and ideas. As a result, they can appear very critical and unfair to people who cannot achieve this level of control. The overly critical trait also links in extremely well with the arrogate weakness as the two are not mutually exclusive and in fact go hand in hand.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6><strong> <i class="fas fa-times" style="color:red"></i> Combative</strong></h6>
                                <p>Architects lean into blind hate and are extremely strict on rules and regulations. Architects will almost always follow regulations and authority figures to the teeth and impose their will and policy on others. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6><strong> <i class="fas fa-times" style="color:red"></i> Romantically Inept</strong></h6>
                                <p>An architect relentless rationality and data driven ideas can leave them clueless in matters of the heart and emotions, they will struggle to understand the early stages of relationships. This disconnect can lead architects to feeling cynical and dismissing of romantic matters.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                </div>
                <h5><strong>Team Composition</strong></h5>
                <p>After performing an analysis on this data, we can assume that as an architect I would perform extremely well leading a team, specifically directing the goal and vision for the project using the architect’s strengths of rationality, determination, and versatility to easily direct and see the project to its completion.
                    <br> <br>Some key areas to be aware off, would be the critical judgement weakness and arrogance, followed by a lack understanding when dealing with the team, I believe these weaknesses can be countered by architects placing a significant priority to understanding and empathy with the team and using their skills to better be aware of and understand people.
