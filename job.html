                <p>Currently I have some moderate skills in vanilla PHP, I can currently create basic PHP SQL CRUD application that has the ability to create, read, update and delete data from a SQL database, this means I have the current skills needed to create a basic yet functional PHP web application. Expanding on this programming experience I have a far superior skill set focused around design and visual elements, iv been doing front end development for several years with WordPress projects and Custom Projects, this has given me a very good core understanding of UX & web design more specifically what’s attractive to the end user, what’s functional for the end user. These two skills front end visual design and my improving programming skills position me in a fantastic spot to launch into this strategy for gaining the dream position.</p>

                <h5><strong>Learning Plan</strong></h5>
                <p>Whilst there are several ways to develop a plan to put myself in a position to gain a role such as the Lead PHP Developer listed, I believe that targeting that specific market is the best and most efficient way to achieve this. This strategy will place me in a position to apply for similar positions in a couple of years.
                </p>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Develop a business plan for a SaaS product with a defined achievable goal (Minimal Viable Product), this could be anything from Status Page to a maintenance Manager suite, the key is to create a product companies would need but also have it be achieved for a project for 1-2 years development.</li>
                    <li>Whilst continuing my study with RMIT I will begin to develop this SaaS product with the aim of developing a small sellable product using the industry standards such as PHP and its MVC framework larval.</li>
                    <li>Market this product as a sole trader with business name. once the SaaS product is in sellable position start to do some basic marketing including setting up as a sole trader and business name with website to sell the product.</li>
                    <li>Use this experience and current product on the market as a demonstration of your skills, this project would server as your reference and experience and would be able to be demonstrated to the potential employer. This product does not have to be a success or earn money as its purpose is to demonstrate your worth and capabilities, however it is important that it appears to be successful, proper, and professional.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>
                    With this strategy you can have a physical and real display of your capabilities as a developer, it would also serve as an excellent education tool for you to learn the frame works and skills during the development time. This allows you to not only gain the skills required for the job but allows you to have a golden display and marketing for your skill set, whilst it may seem like a longer strategy in the short term, this will have a substantial benefit over a great period.
